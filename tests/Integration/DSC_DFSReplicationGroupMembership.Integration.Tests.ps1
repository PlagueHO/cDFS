    These integration tests can only be run on a computer that:
    1. Is a member of an Active Directory domain.
    2. Has access to two Windows Server 2012 or greater servers with
    the FS-DFS-Replication and RSAT-DFS-Mgmt-Con features installed.
    3. An AD User account that has the required permissions that are needed
    to create a DFS Replication Group.

    If the above are available then to allow these tests to be run a
    DSC_DFSReplicationGroupMembership.config.json file must be created in the same folder as
    this file. The content should be a customized version of the following:
    {
        "Username":  "contoso.com\\Administrator",
        "Folders":  [
                        "TestFolder1",
                        "TestFolder2"
                    ],
        "Members":  [
                        "Server1",
                        "Server2"
                    ],
        "ContentPaths":  [
                        "c:\\IntegrationTests\\TestFolder1",
                        "c:\\IntegrationTests\\TestFolder2"
                    ],
        "Password":  "MyPassword"
    }

    If the above are available and configured these integration tests will run.
